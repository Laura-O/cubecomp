<h2>For beginners...</h2>

<p>
  There will be plenty of time to test the equipment (for example
  the official timing device, the Stackmat timer) and discuss the rules
  if you have questions. However, every competitor should have read the
  <a href="http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/regulations/">official WCA regulations</a>
  at least once before attending the competition!
